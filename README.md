# fix-rs
A rudimentary FIX protocol implementation in Rust (WIP)

This is an ongoing personal project to implement FIX protocol in RUST.
Currently, only FIX4.3 is being focused upon but will definitely add more versions once some basic flow is ready
As of now, only message parsing and xml data dictionary parsing modules are ready. Some code is generated at build at compile time.
A WORK IN PROGRESS as I continue to learn more Rust.
